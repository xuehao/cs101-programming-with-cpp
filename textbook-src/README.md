# Programming Abstraction in C++

This project contains a CMake-version source code for the excellent book [**Programming Abstractions in C++**](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/books/ProgrammingAbstractionsInC++/) by Eric Roberts.

## Notes

All projects depend on the `SimpleCxxLib` library. For convenience, the library files are automatically downloaded for each project.

You can check the library here: [The Simple C++ Libraries](https://cppdoc.stickmind.com/)
